- move field-related logic from Scene into FieldCalculator
  - takes parameters (e.g., focal length) not objects (lens)

- add Shot class
  - has #camera, #scene
  - has simple methods to calculate exposure or field

- rework Scene class
  - has brightness range instead of single brightness
  - doesn't have camera
  
- move class methods from Camera into Cameras

- rename Exposure -> ExposureCalculator

- rename *Value classes
  - ApertureValue -> Value
  - move to main directory

- change {min,max}_{shutter,aperture} to Range
  - add #{shutter,aperture}_range to parse string representation

- fix Brightness/Illumination
  - use correct units & math
    - illumination: lux, foot-candle
    - brightness: cd/m2, foot-lambert
  - change ExposureCalculator to take 'light' instead of 'brightness'
    - handles either Brightness or Illumination

- rework units
  - each has #to_XXX
  - classes:
    - Aperture (f/stop)
      - Value (Av)
      - Uniform (US)
    - Shutter (secs) [was Time]
      - Value (Tv)
    - Brightness (lux?)
      - Value (Bv)
    - Sensitivity (ISO)
      - Value (Sv)
    - Length (meters)
      - Imperial (feet/inches)
    - Angle (degrees)

- build tests for calculators (use existing tools?)

- convert Tool#test into something useful
  
- create Subject class
  - distance
  - height/width/depth
  - near/far depth of field
  - handles DoF calculations
  
- add print size to Scene
  - calculateÂ best CoC according to print size
  
- create Medium class
  - eg, film, plate, instant, CCD/CMOS
  - has #sensitivity
  - part of Camera

- add shutter range/current to Lens
  - camera.shutter || lens.shutter

- add common brightness values to Brightness class
  - eg, open shade, bright sun, etc.
    
- add lighting formulas
